These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases. In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely. Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy. Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial.

495,v::ALK Fusion,798.0,"Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib.

There is overlap with these regions and reported regions of hotspot p53 mutations, where it is observed that hotspots for detrimental mutation correspond to more highly evolutionary conserved regions. While there is agreement and overlap between different reports, the literature does not seem to indicate an exact consensus on these regions of human p53 at this time, but the four highly conserved regions are part of the DNA binding domain, and are reported to exist within codons 97 to 292.",[],[2993],{<CIViC source 1423>},"[1423, 1743, 1744]","[<CIViC source 1423>, <CIViC source 1744>, <CIViC source 1743>]",[1300]

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 34 of NUP214 to exon 2 of ABL1 (NUP214-ABL1 34-2). In T-ALL, the fusion is typically expressed from amplified extrachromosomal bodies (episomes) that arise when the genomic region from ABL1 to NUP214 circularizes to generate the NUP214-ABL1 fusion. In B-ALL, the fusion commonly results from an intrachromosomal duplication involving chromosome 9, with breakpoints within the NUP214 and ABL1 genes. The fusion has been identified in 6% of cases of T-lymphoblastic leukemia and rare cases of B-lymphoblastic leukemia by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, single nucleotide polymorphism array, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and fluorescence in situ hybridization targeting the ABL1 gene. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the WD40 repeat and coiled-coil domains of NUP214 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and MAPK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The case report that illustrates the clinical significance of the NUP214-ABL1 fusion describes a 6-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia with normal karyotype. Both patients demonstrated minimal residual disease after induction chemotherapy, and later experienced relapse after either consolidation therapy or bone marrow transplant. Dasatinib was then prescribed and follow-up information is available for the older child, who successfully achieved a complete response for three months before succumbing to the disease. The clinical details of this case could predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).","The NUP214 -ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the NUP214 (Nucleoporin 214) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein).

The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with TKIs and are the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).",['RCSD1-ABL1'],"[7248, 7783, 9164, 9166, 9167, 9168, 9213, 9075, 9162, 9163, 9165, 9169, 11618, 7249, 9214]","{<CIViC source 3886>, <CIViC source 4017>, <CIViC source 2458>, <CIViC source 3888>, <CIViC source 2495>, <CIViC source 3890>, <CIViC source 3892>, <CIViC source 3891>, <CIViC source 2498>, <CIViC source 3101>, <CIViC source 3889>, <CIViC source 3921>}",[],[],[2681]

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 27 of FOXP1to exon 4 of ABL1 (FOXP1-ABL1). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(3;9)(p12;q34) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and NGS. FOXP1 is critical for the transcriptional regulatory network of B lymphopoiesis; it may also act as a tumor suppressor gene. Absence or deficiency of FOXP1 during early B-cell development may block pro-B cell to pre-B cell development. The FOXP1-ABL1 fusion protein leads to activated tyrosine kinase and may further alter the critical cellular function of these 2 genes. Clinical significance: The FOXP1-ABL1 fusion has been documented in 3 young adult patients (2 male, 1 female) with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. One patient had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib) added to the chemotherapy regimens, who had bone marrow tested negative for MRD at end of consolidation.

2730,PAX5::JAK2 Fusion,30.0,"The PAX5-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the PAX5 (Paired Box 5) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 5 of PAX5 to exon 19 of JAK2 (PAX5-JAK2 5-19). The fusion is hypothesized to result from an intrachromosomal translocation, inversion, or deletion of chromosome 9 (involving loci p13 and p24), and has been identified by RNA sequencing, RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and FISH in patients B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the DNA-binding paired domain from PAX5 and the JH1 kinase domain from JAK2. A pre-clinical study has revealed that this fusion protein deregulates the PAX5 transcriptional pathway while also autophosphorylating the JAK2 kinase domain, thereby promoting downstream signaling by signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Clinical significance: As a diagnostic biomarker, the PAX5-JAK2 fusion in B-lymphoblastic leukemia is frequently associated with the BCR-ABL1-like subtype. As a prognostic marker, the fusion has been associated with intermediate to high-risk disease. As a predictive marker, the PAX5-JAK2 fusion has been shown in pre-clinical data to predict response to treatment with JAK2 inhibitors. Prospective clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of adding JAK2 inhibitors to treatment of B-lymphoblastic leukemia patients with JAK2 fusions (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723994).","The PAX5-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the PAX5 (Paired Box 5) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein).

JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. OFD1 is a centrosomal protein of primary cilia implicated in Oral-Facial-Digital Syndrome type 1, but it has not been previously described in hematologic malignancies. The published breakpoint joins exon 22 of OFD1 to exon 13 of JAK2 (OFD1-JAK2 22-13). This fusion is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(X;9)(p22;p24), and has been identified in two patients by RNA sequencing, one of which demonstrated the abnormal karyotype 46,XY,-17+mar[11]/46,XY[9]. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the FERM and SH2 domains from OFD1 and the JH2 pseudokinase and JH1 kinase domains from JAK2. The inclusion of the JH1 kinase domain is hypothesized to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Functional analysis of the OFD1-JAK2 fusion protein is reportedly underway. Clinical significance: The novel OFD1-JAK2 fusion has been documented in one 3-year-old and one 11-year-old boy with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. Both children successfully maintained first complete remission following induction chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, with as long as 6 years of follow up. While neither patient was treated with a JAK2 inhibitor, the JH1 kinase domain present within the OFD1-JAK2 fusion protein may offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Prospective clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of adding JAK2 inhibitors to the treatment of pediatric B-lymphoblastic leukemia patients with JAK2 fusions (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723994).","The OFD1-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the OFD1 (Oral-Facial-Digital Syndrome 1) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein).

While neither patient was treated with a JAK2 inhibitor, the JH1 kinase domain present within the OFD1-JAK2 fusion protein may offer a target for therapeutic inhibition.

JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 18 of SMU1 to exon 12 of JAK2 (SMU1-JAK2 18-12). The fusion is hypothesized to result from an intrachromosomal translocation, inversion, or deletion of chromosome 9 (involving loci p21 and p24), and has been identified by RNA sequencing in an older adult patient with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the LisH, CTLH, HisP, and Wd40 domains from SMU1 and the JH2 pseudokinase and JH1 kinase domains from JAK2.

JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 10 of GOLGA5 to exon 12 of JAK2 (GOLGA5-JAK2 10-12). The fusion is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(9;14)(p24;q32), and has been identified in one patient by RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the coiled coil domain from GOLGA5 and an aberrantly activated JH1 kinase domain from JAK2, which is thought to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The inclusion of the JH1 domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The novel GOLGA5-JAK2 fusion has been documented in one 10-year-old boy with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia with complex karyotype.

The first patient was a child with high risk Ph-like ALL and the second patient was a 36 years old male who had a poor prednisone response and did not reach complete remission after vincristine-dexamethasone-rituximab or a combination of dasatinib and chemotherapy. The second patient died early of sepsis in a context of uncontrolled disease (survival 2 months).",['LSM14A-ABL1'],"[9080, 9153]","{<CIViC source 3879>, <CIViC source 2498>}",[],[],[3272]

3156,SFPQ::ABL1 Fusion,32.5,"The SFPQ -ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SFPQ (Splicing factor proline and glutamine rich) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 9 of SFPQ to exon 4 of ABL1 (SFPQ -ABL1). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(1;9)(p34;q34) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The role of the partner gene SFPQ in this fusion remains to be investigated. SFPQ encodes for a protein belonging to a new functionally related group of fusion partners for tyrosine kinases involved in pre-mRNA processing. The presence of 2 coiled-coil domains in the 9 remaining exons of SFPQ could theoretically lead to SFPQ–ABL1 oligomerization, thus leading to constitutive activation of the resulting tyrosine kinase, as reported with other partner genes. Though uncommon, this translocation might be targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Clinical significance: The SFPQ -ABL1 fusion has been documented in six patients (3 male, 3 female) between the ages of 10 and 34 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens, who did not have relapse. One additional patient who did not have tyrosine kinase inhibitor also did not suffer from relapse. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Functional studies are needed to substantiate the efficacy of TKI treatment of this particular ABL-class fusion.","The SFPQ -ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the SFPQ (Splicing factor proline and glutamine rich) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein).
