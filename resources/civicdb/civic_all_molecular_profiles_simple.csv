1,BCR::ABL1 Fusion,"The BCR-ABL fusion protein, commonly referred to as the Philadelphia chromosome, is one of the most studied fusion genes in cancer. It has widely been considered the initiating event in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). However, despite its ability to initiate disease in mice, its status as an initiating mutation is in dispute. In what is commonly used as the poster-child for targeted therapeutics, the development and use of imatinib in the clinic has led to profound improvements in the prognosis of the disease. However, imatinib resistance is still seen in patients with mutations in the ABL kinase domain of the fusion, most notably the T315I variant. In patients resistant to imatinib, either acquired or otherwise, second generation BCR-ABL TKI's (dasatinib and nilotinib) have seen some success in delivering a tumor response. Third generation ABL1 inhibitor ponatinib is the only FDA approved drug with activity against T315I . However due to risk of life-threatening blood clots and severe narrowing of blood vessels ponatinib is ONLY approved for T315I-positive CML or T315I-positive Ph+ ALL or in cases of CML, Ph+ ALL with resistance or intolerance to other approved ABL1 inhibitors.",353.5
2,ABL1 T315I,"While the efficacy of imatinib has revolutionized chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) treatment, it is still not a cure-all. Both initial resistance and acquired resistance as a result of selection have been seen in a small subset of CML patients. The ABL kinase domain mutation T315I (aka T334I) has been shown to be one such mutation that confers resistance to imatinib. Second generation TKI's (dasatinib and ponatinib) specific to BCR-ABL have shown efficacy in treating resistant cases.",0.0

4,AKT1 E17K,"AKT1 E17K is a recurrent mutation that has been observed in breast, colorectal, lung, and ovarian cancer. It has been convincingly shown to be an activating mutation resulting in PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway activity. It has been suggested that this mutation decreases the cell's sensitivity to AKT1 allosteric kinase inhibitors. This, and other AKT1 mutations, are the subject of much research and development for therapeutics.",33.5
5,EML4::ALK Fusion,"The EML4-ALK fusion variant 1 consisting of ALK kinase domain (exons 20-29) fused to EML4 exons 1-13 is the most common EML4-ALK variant, and was discovered in non-small cell lung cancer. Multiple EML4 breakpoint shave been described with differential sensitivity to inhibitors with variant 1 showing greater sensitivity than 3a in cell lines. EML4-ALK is crizotinib sensitive; however, several mutations that confer resistance mutations have been described in case studies. In the only clinical trial for crizotinib that included determination of EML4-ALK variant type in a subset of its participants, a very high response rate was observed, although the numbers were insufficient to validate correlation of variant type to outcome. Preclinical studies with this variant have indicated sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitors.",48.0
8,ALK F1174L,"ALK F1174L has been observed as recurrent in neuroblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and other cancer types. Neuroblastoma cells containing this mutation have shown resistance to low doses of criztonib. However, increased dosage can overcome this resistance in cell lines studies. TAE684 has also proven effective in both NSCLC and neuroblastoma F1174L containing cells.",33.5
9,ALK R1275Q,"ALK R1275Q has been observed as a recurrent mutation in  neuroblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as other cancer types.

10,ARAF S214C,"ARAF S214C has been found to be a recurrent oncogenic mutation in non-small cell lung cancer. It has been shown to confer sensitivity to sorafenib and trametenib in cell lines. In a case study of advanced stage lung adenocarcinoma harboring this mutation, sorafenib also acheived near-complete clinical remission. This case has brought more interest to the variant from a research and clinical perspective.",14.0

12,BRAF V600E,"BRAF V600E has been shown to be recurrent in many cancer types. It is one of the most widely studied variants in cancer. This variant is correlated with poor prognosis in certain cancer types, including colorectal cancer and papillary thyroid cancer. The targeted therapeutic dabrafenib has been shown to be effective in clinical trials with an array of BRAF mutations and cancer types. Dabrafenib has also shown to be effective when combined with the MEK inhibitor trametinib in colorectal cancer and melanoma. However, in patients with TP53, CDKN2A and KRAS mutations, dabrafenib resistance has been reported. Ipilimumab, regorafenib, vemurafenib, and a number of combination therapies have been successful in treating V600E mutations. However, cetuximab and panitumumab have been largely shown to be ineffective without supplementary treatment.",1433.5

18,CCND1 Amplification,CCND1 amplification has been implicated in poorer prognosis in non-small cell lung cancer.,47.0
19,CCND1 Expression,"CCND1 expression, and its prognositc impact, is still in dispute. Three experiments in non-small cell lung cancer have shown it to have no impact on survival, but three additional studies have shown it results in poorer prognosis. There is also some ambiguity in how the boundaries between expression and overexpression are defined.",30.0
20,CCND1 Overexpression,"Cyclin D has been shown in many cancer types to be misregulated. Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are misregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. While Cyclin D2 has only been found to be significantly misregulated in glioma, Cyclin D1 in particular seems to be a pan-cancer actor. Cyclin D misregulation has been shown to lead to poorer outcomes in a number of studies, and currently there are no FDA-approved targeted therapies.",116.0

Well established for their oncogenic properties, the cyclins and the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK's) they activate have been the focus of major research and development efforts over the past decade. The methods by which the cyclins are deregulated are widely variable, and range from genomic amplification to promoter methylation changes. Cyclin D3 loss has been reported in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), a seemingly unique trend when compared to the amplifcations and overexpressions of the other cyclin D's. Treating cyclin D3 knockout mice with the targeted therapeutic palbociclib significantly increased the median survival of a Notch-driven model of T-ALL.",3.0
24,CCNE1 Overexpression,"Cyclin E, while currenly not as widely implicated as its counterpart, cyclin D, has been implicated in various carcinomas, including breast, gastric, stomach and colorectal. High levels of cyclin E, either by gene amplification or overexpression, are correlated with later stage disease and have been shown to lead to poorer prognosis in gastic carcinoma. It has also been shown, in lung cancer specifically, that neoplastic cells with higher levels of the cyclin E/CDK2 complex are more radiosensitive than their lowly expressed counterparts.",42.0
25,CDK4 EXPRESSION,"CDK4, along with its partner CDK6, are key players in cell cycle progression. The complex has been implicated in a number of cancer types, and is the focus of therapeutic research and development. One targeted therapy for CDK inhibition is palbociclib, which may slow the growth of advanced stage breast cancers. It has also been shown, in mouse, that CDK inhibition may sensitize mutant PIK3CA tumors to PI3K inhibitors.",10.0

It has also been shown, in mouse, that CDK inhibition may sensitize mutant PIK3CA tumors to PI3K inhibitors.",0.0
27,CDKN2A Promoter Hypermethylation,"CDKN2A loss has been shown to be a significant event in a number of cancer types. One mechanism by which this can occur is by hypermethylation of the CDKN2A promoter region. While no targeted therapeutic has been engaged in clinical trials, the prognostic impact has been studied by a number of meta-analyses. The prognostic impact of promoter hypermethylation has been relatively ambiguous. Many studies have shown significant p-values suggesting poorer prognostic outcomes for patients with hypermethylation in colorectal, liver, and younger lung cancer patients. This being said, there is still research to be done before this becomes a widely-accepted prognostic indicator.",30.0
28,CEBPA N-TERMINAL FRAME SHIFT,"CEBPA N-terminal frame shift mutations that result in a premature stop codon are associated with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). CEBPA mutations are associated with a favorable prognosis; however, NPM1 and FLT3 mutations should also be assessed in CN-AML patients as concurrent mutations may have prognostic implications. N-terminal frame shift mutations within amino acids 1-120 have been shown to disrupt expression of the full-length 42kDa isoform while maintaining expression of a 30kDa isoform (translated from the AUG at full-length protein isoform amino acid M120). This 30kDa isoform exhibits dominant negative activity.",18.0

31,DNAJB1::PRKACA Fusion,"This fusion has been found to be very recurrent in the rare form of adolescent liver cancer, fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma. In one study, this fusion was observed in 15/15 FL-HCC cases examined and functional studies found that the fusion retained kinase activity. The presence of this fusion may be used as a diagnostic marker for this rare tumor type.",75.0
32,DNMT3A R882,"DNMT3A R882 mutations are associated with cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) with R882H as the most common form. Mutations in DNMT3A have largely been associated with poorer prognosis, however this is not consistent across all studies. This may be a result of patient age or combining R882 and non-R882 mutations during analysis as studies have indicated independent mechanisms of action and differential prognostic implications for these mutation types. One study that independently analyzed R882 and non-R882 mutations showed R882 mutations were associated with poorer prognosis than patients with wildtype and non-R882 mutations, but only in older patients with AML.",510.0
33,EGFR L858R,"EGFR L858R has long been recognized as a functionally significant mutation in cancer, and is one of the most prevalent single mutations in lung cancer. Best described in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the mutation seems to confer sensitivity to first and second generation TKI's like gefitinib and neratinib. NSCLC patients with this mutation treated with TKI's show increased overall and progression-free survival, as compared to chemotherapy alone. Third generation TKI's are currently in clinical trials that specifically focus on mutant forms of EGFR, a few of which have shown efficacy in treating patients that failed to respond to earlier generation TKI therapies.",379.0
34,EGFR T790M,"EGFR T790M was one of the very first mutations recognized to confer resistance to targeted therapies in non-small cell lung cancer. While successful in amplified EGFR, the efficacy of the first and second generation TKI's (erlotinib, gefitinib, neratinib) in treating patients harboring this mutation before treatment is notably lower. This lack of efficacy can likely be to blame for the poorer prognosis for patients with this mutation as compared to patients with wildtype EGFR or other types of EGFR mutations. Approximately half of EGFR mutant tumors with acquired resistance to TKI inhibition have been shown to harbor this mutation, implicating it as a mechanism of acquired therapy resistence. A third generation TKI (osimertinib) has been approved for the treatment of EGFR T790M mutant NSCLC. Patients positive for T790M in a plasma-based test have similar outcomes like those with tumor biopsy testing.",406.25

55,FLT3 ITD,"FLT3-ITD (internal tandem duplications) frequently occur in patients with hematologic malignancies such as chronic myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome, but particularly in cytogenetically normal AML (CN-AML). These duplication events disrupt the juxtamembrane domain of FLT3 and can be the result of a duplication of internal FLT3 sequence or other unrelated sequence resulting in an in-frame duplication event. The length of these duplications can vary widely which may have prognostic consequences, but this has not been conclusively determined. FLT3-ITD mutations overall have generally been associated with poor prognosis. Additional genes associated with CN-AML such as NPM1 may modulate the prognosis associated with this variant.",448.5

R172 is analogous to IDH1 R132 mutations and leads to neomorphic enzymatic activity. Specifically this mutation ""catalyzes the conversion of alpha ketoglurarate to beta-hydrozyglutarate"" leading to increased levels of beta-hydrozyglutarate. This in turn leads to hypermethylation of target genes and an inhibition of cellular differentiation. R172 mutations generally lead to worse overall survival and higher rates of relapse compared to the most common IDH2 mutations in AML (R140).",105.0

The clinical impact of these deletions is unknown for many cancer types however a poor outcome has been observed in leukemia based disease. This gene has been strongly implicated as a regulator for ""normal hematopoiesis"". In regards to BCP ALL, mouse models have shown that mutations in IKZF1 are not sufficient in and of themselves to cause disease. Haploinsuffeciency in combination with BCR-ABL1 however, will accelerate leukemiagenesis possibly indicating that at least in regards to BCP ALL these are secondary events that may be necessary for the development of leukaemic clones.",240.0

The two mutations are usually heterozygous and mutually exclusive and result in an increased similarity to an ETS binding domain and may act as a binding site to an ETS transcription factor. These mutations are thought to be early events in tumorgenesis and aid in cellular immortality. Decreased overall survival in patients with these mutations have been observed in medulloblastoma, thyroid cancer, urogenital cancer, melanoma, and laryngeal tumors.

However, there is no perfect overlap between p16 expression and HPV status with some 10-12.5% of HPV-negative tumors expressing p16. (Seiwert, T JCO, 2014). p16 positivity is a well-established positive prognostic factor in squamous cell cancer of the head and neck in the primary and, as increasing evidence suggests, recurrent/metastatic disease settings.

302,ERBB2 Amplification,"Her2 (ERBB2) amplifications are seen in up to 20% of breast cancers and were associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis when discovered. Trastuzumab first found considerable success, and was approved for treatment, in HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) which had progressed under chemotherapy. These metastatic cancers nonetheless progressed under trastuzumab, and other forms of therapy were studied for next line treatments, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Lapatinib, a reversible inhibitor of tyrosine kinase activity in ErbB1 and ErbB2, and afatinib, an irreversible inhibitor of all 4 ErbB forms were shown to have activity in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. Interestingly trastuzumab itself also turned out to remain effective in treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC. The LUX-Breast 1 trial compared a TKI-based treatment (afatinib) to a trastuzumab-based treatment of trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC, and the LUX-Breast 3 trial addressed TKI application in the context of HER2 MBC with difficult to treat brain metastases. In neither of these cases was the TKI more effective, making successful future replacement of trastuzumab-based therapy with a TKI in trastuzumab-progressed HER2 MBC seem unlikely. Instead, a potential role for TKIs in this disease context is revealed in preclinical work suggesting synergism between TKI and trastuzumab action, and clinical trials with lapatinib or afatinib combined with trastuzumab indicate that dual HER2 blockade may be an effective therapy. Dual antibody HER2 blockade with pertuzumab instead of TKI in HER2 MBC has also recently shown strong results in the CLEOPATRA trial. HER2 overexpression is targeted in neoadjuvant breast cancer treatment, and has also been successfully targeted in gastric cancer.",891.0

In breast cancer PIK3CA mutations have been associated with better prognosis, and a greater survival outcome, however the PI3K pathway is also associated with increased drug resistance (trastuzumab/lapatinib). PIK3CA mutations in both HNSCC and CRC have been associated with resistance to anti-EGFR therapeutic agents and mutations in exon 9 and 20 are associated with a poorer prognosis in CRC.

495,v::ALK Fusion,"Following the initial discovery and characterization of NPM-ALK fusion mutation in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL), EML4-ALK fusions were found to be driver mutations in a subset of lung adenocarcinomas. ALK fusions bring the C-terminal ALK kinase domain together with the N terminal region of the fusion partner, and have since been found in a range of cancers including inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor, renal cell carcinoma, diffuse large B cell lymphoma and colorectal cancer. In a Phase I trial for crizotinib, a 92% response rate was seen in the subset of patients with a specific EML4-ALK variant, which was higher than the 57% rate in the overall ALK-rearranged population, but the subpopulation numbers were insufficient to correlate variant type with patient response. Due to restricted wild-type ALK expression, and also mild phenotypes seen in ALK knockout mice, ALK fusions are desirable targets. ALK inhibitor TAE684 was used in initial characterizations of ALK fusion cancer drivers, and crizotinib – a small molecule ATP-competitor RTK inhibitor which is highly selective for ALK and MET - has been approved as first line therapy in ALK-rearranged NSCLC. ALK-rearrangement defines an NSCLC subtype that makes up 3-5% of NSCLC cases, and is characterized by higher proportions of younger patients and never smokers. EML4-ALK variant 1 is the most common ALK fusion in NSCLC and was the first to be discovered and demonstrate cancer driver properties in vitro and in mouse models. A Phase I study of crizotinib in ALK-rearranged NSCLC demonstrated an increase in overall survival when compared to standard chemotherapy. These and other initial results prompted accelerated approval for crizotinib in NSCLC. Continued clinical work demonstrated benefit with crizotinib over chemotherapy in multi-armed studies, and as first line therapy. Crizotinib was also found to remain beneficial to NSCLC patients who had progressed on crizotinib. Additionally, crizotinib was shown to increase intracranial disease control in brain metastasis occurring from ALK-rearranged NSCLC.",798.0
496,EML4::ALK e20::e20,"EML4-ALK variant 2 consists of a fusion of the ALK kinase domain (exons 20-29) with EML4 exons 1-20. Variant 2 has cytoplasmic distribution and makes up ~10% of EML4-ALK fusions found in NSCLC,. Although the specific variant is not consistently reported, single cases demonstrating response to crizotinib treatment in NSCLC and a differentiated malignant neoplasm of unknown origin have been reported. In vitro, this variant has shown greater sensitivity to ALK inhibition with TAE684 and crizotinib than the EML4-ALK variants 1 (E13;A20), 3a (E6;A20) and 3b (E6ins33;A20). The variant was reported to be less stable in cells than other variants, and may be a client protein of Hsp90. Along these lines the variant has shown preclinical sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibition.",16.5

The two variants were found to originate from a single genomic rearrangement, and 3a/3b is found in ~ 30% of EML4-ALK positive NSCLC. Variant 3a has cytoplasmic and nuclear distribution. In vitro, these variants have shown sensitivity to ALK inhibitors TAE684 and crizotinib but less sensitive than other EML4-ALK variants. The H2228 cell line contains 3a and 3b variants and is described as having cyctostatic response to ALK inhibition as opposed to apoptotic. In a study of 31 NSCLC patients with EML4-ALK rearrangements, 4/5 patients with the 3a variant showed a partial response while 1 showed progressive disease (the only PD observed). In cells the 3a variant was reported to be more stable than other variants, less sensitive to crizotinib and not to respond to Hsp90 inhibition.",25.0

761,ACTB::GLI1 Fusion,"Fusion of the hedgehog pathway component gene GLI1 to the β-actin gene (ACTB)  has been described as a mechanism of GLI1,and by extension hedgehog pathway, activation. These fusions have been described in histologically distinctive soft tissue tumours showing a pericytic phenotype.  Gene fusions retain the DNA-binding zinc finger domains of GLI1 and it is likely that the replacement of the promoter region of GLI1with that of the ubiquitously expressed ACTB gene leads to deregulation of GLI expression and its downstream target genes.",15.0

1274,TP53 CONSERVED DOMAIN MUT,"This conserved domain mutation variant covers mutations in regions of p53 reported to be highly conserved during evolution. These regions span codons 117-143 (region II), 171-181 (region III), 234-258 (region (IV), and 270-286 (region V). Region I covers approximately codons 10 through 25 but does not appear in all studies on conserved domain mutations. There is overlap with these regions and reported regions of hotspot p53 mutations, where it is observed that hotspots for detrimental mutation correspond to more highly evolutionary conserved regions. While there is agreement and overlap between different reports, the literature does not seem to indicate an exact consensus on these regions of human p53 at this time, but the four highly conserved regions are part of the DNA binding domain, and are reported to exist within codons 97 to 292.",15.0

1615,VHL R167Q (c.500G>A),R167Q is the most common point mutation in hereditary Von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease and disrupts the VHL genes binding to elongin C reducing the levels of the VHL-elongin B-elongin C (VBC) E3 ligase complex and inhibiting the ability of VHL to regulate HIF2α. This partial function in turn leads to an increased risk of tumorgenesis. VHL derived clear cell renal cell carcinoma models however have shown the proteasome inhibitors bortezomib and carfilzomib can act to stabilize mutant VHL-R167Q leading to downregulation of HIF2α and suprressed tumorgenesis.,110.0

In many cases these tumors were negative for the more common known driver genes of these diseases (e.g., KRAS wild-type pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma).

The fusion is generated by a ~320-kb interstitial deletion in Xp22 (in the so-called pseudo-autosomal (PAR) region) which fuses the exon 1 of P2RY8 with the exon 1 of CRLF2. The P2RY8-CRLF2 fusion has been shown to be enriched in Down syndrome B-ALL cases.

2529,NUP214::ABL1 Fusion,"The NUP214 -ABL1 fusion is composed of part of the NUP214 (Nucleoporin 214) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (ABL proto-oncogene 1, non-receptor tyrosine kinase) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 34 of NUP214 to exon 2 of ABL1 (NUP214-ABL1 34-2). In T-ALL, the fusion is typically expressed from amplified extrachromosomal bodies (episomes) that arise when the genomic region from ABL1 to NUP214 circularizes to generate the NUP214-ABL1 fusion. In B-ALL, the fusion commonly results from an intrachromosomal duplication involving chromosome 9, with breakpoints within the NUP214 and ABL1 genes. The fusion has been identified in 6% of cases of T-lymphoblastic leukemia and rare cases of B-lymphoblastic leukemia by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification, single nucleotide polymorphism array, real-time polymerase chain reaction, and fluorescence in situ hybridization targeting the ABL1 gene. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the WD40 repeat and coiled-coil domains of NUP214 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and MAPK and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The case report that illustrates the clinical significance of the NUP214-ABL1 fusion describes a 6-year-old boy and a 15-year-old girl with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia with normal karyotype. Both patients demonstrated minimal residual disease after induction chemotherapy, and later experienced relapse after either consolidation therapy or bone marrow transplant. Dasatinib was then prescribed and follow-up information is available for the older child, who successfully achieved a complete response for three months before succumbing to the disease. The clinical details of this case could predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).",27.0

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 3 of SNX2 to exon 4 of ABL1 (SNX2-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(5;9)(p23.2;q34.12) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the sorting nexin, N-terminal domain of SNX2 and the SH2, tyrosine kinase, and F actin binding domains of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The SNX2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in six young men between the ages of 7 and 29 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (imatinib and dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens that, while producing initially encouraging results, ultimately did not prevent these individuals from succumbing to their disease. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors and is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).",30.5

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 2 or, more frequently, exon 3 of RCSD1 to exon 4 of ABL1 (RCSD1-ABL1 3-4). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(1;9)(q24.2;q34.12) and has been identified by FISH/karyotype, RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing.

Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The RCSD1-ABL1 fusion has been documented in greater than fifteen pediatric and adult patients with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. The majority that that were exposed to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs: imatinib, dasatinib, or ponatinib) experienced durable remissions until the TKIs were discontinued. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with TKIs and are the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).",80.5

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 27 of FOXP1to exon 4 of ABL1 (FOXP1-ABL1). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(3;9)(p12;q34) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and NGS. FOXP1 is critical for the transcriptional regulatory network of B lymphopoiesis; it may also act as a tumor suppressor gene. Absence or deficiency of FOXP1 during early B-cell development may block pro-B cell to pre-B cell development. The FOXP1-ABL1 fusion protein leads to activated tyrosine kinase and may further alter the critical cellular function of these 2 genes. Clinical significance: The FOXP1-ABL1 fusion has been documented in 3 young adult patients (2 male, 1 female) with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. One patient had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib) added to the chemotherapy regimens, who had bone marrow tested negative for MRD at end of consolidation. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Functional studies are needed to substantiate the efficacy of TKI treatment of this particular ABL-class fusion.",10.0

JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion. Known breakpoint/splice variants join exon 10 of ATF7IP to exon 8 of JAK2 (ATF7IP-JAK2 10-8), exon 13 of ATF7IP to exon 16 of JAK2 (ATF7IP-JAK2 13-16), or exon 13 of ATF7IP to exon 17 of JAK2 (ATF7IP-JAK2 13-17). The fusion is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(9;12) (p24;p13.1), and has been identified by RNA sequencing and Sanger sequencing in three adult patients with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the coiled coil and MDN1 domains from ATF7IP and the JH2 pseudokinase and JH1 kinase domains from JAK2. The coiled coil domain is hypothesized to constitutively activate the JAK2 kinase domain, thereby upregulating the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Clinical significance: The novel ATF7IP-JAK2 fusion has been documented in three cases for which specific clinical information is unavailable. A pre-clinical xenograft model containing the fusion was sensitive to exposure to the JAK2 inhibitor, ruxolitinib. Therefore, the presence of the JAK2 JH1 kinase domain in the fusion protein may offer a target for therapeutic inhibition.

The fusion stems from a reciprocal translocation t(1;9) (q31.1;p24), and has been identified by FISH and RNA sequencing in one young adult patient with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the TPR/MLP1/MLP2-like protein domain from TERF2 and the JH2 pseudokinase domain and intact JH1 kinase domain from JAK2, as confirmed by RT-PCR and Sanger sequencing. The inclusion of the JH1 kinase domain is hypothesized to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Functional analysis of the TPR-JAK2 fusion protein has not been performed. Clinical significance: The novel TPR-JAK2 fusion has been documented in one case for which specific clinical information is unavailable. However, the presence of the JAK2 JH1 kinase domain in the fusion protein may offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Prospective clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of adding JAK2 inhibitors to the treatment of B-lymphoblastic leukemia patients with JAK2 fusions (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723994).",7.5

2728,ETV6::JAK2 Fusion,"The ETV6-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the ETV6 (ETS Variant Transcription Factor 6) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion. Known breakpoint/splice variants join exon 4 of ETV6 to exon 17 of JAK2 (ETV6-JAK2 4-17), exon 5 of ETV6 to exon 12 of JAK2 (ETV6-JAK2 5-12), or exon 5 of ETV6 to exon 19 of JAK2 (ETV6-JAK2 5-19). The fusion results from the reciprocal translocation t(9;12)(p24;p13), cytogenetically cryptic, and has been identified by FISH and RNA sequencing. The fusion gene is expressed from the der(9) chromosome. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the PNT domain from ETV6 and JH1 kinase domain from JAK2. The ETV6 PNT domain is hypothesized to result in dimerization, which leads to aberrant JAK2 kinase domain activation. Depending on the breakpoint variant, the fusion protein may also contain the JAK2 JH2 pseudokinase domain. The inclusion of the JH1 domain may affect functional effects and disease specificity of the abnormal fusion. Functionally, the fusion results in aberrant activation of JAK2 kinase, leading to activation of downstream signaling through the signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The ETV6-JAK2 fusion is associated with hematologic malignancies and has been observed in B-lymphoblastic leukemia (~10%), T-lymphoblastic leukemia (isolated cases), and myeloid/lymphoid neoplasms with eosinophilia and gene rearrangements (rare cases). Clinical significance: As a diagnostic biomarker, the ETV6-JAK2 fusion in B-lymphoblastic leukemia is associated with the BCR-ABL1-like subtype. As a prognostic marker, the ETV6-JAK2 fusion has been associated with high-risk disease. As a predictive marker, the ETV6-JAK2 fusion has been shown by limited pre-clinical data and case reports to predict response to treatment with JAK2 inhibitors. Prospective clinical trials are ongoing to evaluate the efficacy of adding JAK2 inhibitors to treatment of pediatric B-lymphoblastic leukemia patients with JAK2 fusions (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723994).",25.0
2729,BCR::JAK2 Fusion,"The BCR-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the BCR (Breakpoint Cluster Region) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion. Known breakpoint/splice variants join exon 14 of BCR to exon 17 of JAK2 (BCR-JAK2 4-17) and exon 1 of BCR to exons 15 (BCR-JAK2 1-15), 17 (BCR-JAK2 1-17), or 19 (BCR-JAK2 1-19). The fusion results from the reciprocal translocation t(9;22)(p24;p11.2), and has been identified by karyotype analysis, FISH, RT-PCR, targeted ligation amplification (TLA), and RNA sequencing. The fusion gene is expressed from the der(9) chromosome. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the coiled coil domain from BCR and the JH1 kinase domain from JAK2. Depending on the breakpoint variant, the fusion protein may also contain the JAK2 JH2 pseudokinase domain. In pre-clinical studies, the coiled coil domain of BCR has been shown to mediate oligomeric activation of the JAK2 kinase domain, thereby promoting downstream signaling by signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The BCR-JAK2 fusion is associated with hematologic malignancies and has been observed in myeloproliferative neoplasms with eosinophilia (multiple cases), B-lymphoblastic leukemia (multiple cases), acute myeloid leukemia (a rare case), and B-cell lymphoma (rare case of Burkitt lymphoma). Clinical significance: As a diagnostic biomarker in B-lymphoblastic leukemia, the BCR-JAK2 fusion is frequently observed in the BCR-ABL1-like subtype. As a prognostic marker, the fusion appears to be associated with high-risk disease in pediatric and adult populations. As a predictive marker, patients whose diseases exhibit the BCR-JAK2 fusion have experienced partial responses or even complete remission with hydroxyurea and/or interferon alfa. Case reports have demonstrated the limited utility of tyrosine kinase inhibitors. One patient diagnosed with a myeloid neoplasm initially responded to the JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib, but relapsed after 18 months. Current research has suggested a survival advantage following allogeneic or autologous stem cell transplantation.",35.0
2730,PAX5::JAK2 Fusion,"The PAX5-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the PAX5 (Paired Box 5) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 5 of PAX5 to exon 19 of JAK2 (PAX5-JAK2 5-19). The fusion is hypothesized to result from an intrachromosomal translocation, inversion, or deletion of chromosome 9 (involving loci p13 and p24), and has been identified by RNA sequencing, RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and FISH in patients B-lymphoblastic leukemia. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the DNA-binding paired domain from PAX5 and the JH1 kinase domain from JAK2. A pre-clinical study has revealed that this fusion protein deregulates the PAX5 transcriptional pathway while also autophosphorylating the JAK2 kinase domain, thereby promoting downstream signaling by signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Clinical significance: As a diagnostic biomarker, the PAX5-JAK2 fusion in B-lymphoblastic leukemia is frequently associated with the BCR-ABL1-like subtype. As a prognostic marker, the fusion has been associated with intermediate to high-risk disease. As a predictive marker, the PAX5-JAK2 fusion has been shown in pre-clinical data to predict response to treatment with JAK2 inhibitors.

JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. OFD1 is a centrosomal protein of primary cilia implicated in Oral-Facial-Digital Syndrome type 1, but it has not been previously described in hematologic malignancies. The published breakpoint joins exon 22 of OFD1 to exon 13 of JAK2 (OFD1-JAK2 22-13). This fusion is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(X;9)(p22;p24), and has been identified in two patients by RNA sequencing, one of which demonstrated the abnormal karyotype 46,XY,-17+mar[11]/46,XY[9]. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the FERM and SH2 domains from OFD1 and the JH2 pseudokinase and JH1 kinase domains from JAK2. The inclusion of the JH1 kinase domain is hypothesized to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Functional analysis of the OFD1-JAK2 fusion protein is reportedly underway. Clinical significance: The novel OFD1-JAK2 fusion has been documented in one 3-year-old and one 11-year-old boy with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia. Both children successfully maintained first complete remission following induction chemotherapy and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, with as long as 6 years of follow up. While neither patient was treated with a JAK2 inhibitor, the JH1 kinase domain present within the OFD1-JAK2 fusion protein may offer a target for therapeutic inhibition.

3083,GOLGA5::JAK2 Fusion,"The GOLGA5-JAK2 fusion is composed of part of the GOLGA5 (Golgin A5) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the JAK2 (Janus Kinase 2) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). JAK2 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 10 of GOLGA5 to exon 12 of JAK2 (GOLGA5-JAK2 10-12). The fusion is predicted to result from a reciprocal translocation t(9;14)(p24;q32), and has been identified in one patient by RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, containing the coiled coil domain from GOLGA5 and an aberrantly activated JH1 kinase domain from JAK2, which is thought to upregulate the pathway shared with signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The inclusion of the JH1 domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The novel GOLGA5-JAK2 fusion has been documented in one 10-year-old boy with BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia with complex karyotype. The clinical details of this case could predict response to treatment with JAK2 inhibitors. A xenograft model created from the patient's malignant cells demonstrated clearance of the leukemic clone in murine peripheral blood upon exposure to ruxolitinib. Moreover, this drug was added to the child's treatment regimen, resulting in nearly undetectable levels of the GOLGA5-JAK2 fusion measured after 64 days of therapy. The patient has reportedly remained in remission 20 months after CAR T-cell infusion and allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. This child was included in the currently ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of JAK2 inhibitors in treating pediatric B-lymphoblastic leukemia with JAK2 fusions (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02723994).",7.5

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 18 of RANBP2 to exon 2 of ABL1 (RANBP2-ABL1 18-2). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(2;9)(p12.3;q34.12) and has been identified by FISH/karyotype and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, includes the leucine zipper of RANBP2 and the tyrosine kinase of ABL1, which is thought to upregulate the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Specifically, the inclusion of the tyrosine kinase domain may affect functionality and offer a target for therapeutic inhibition. Clinical significance: The RANBP2-ABL1 fusion has been documented in several juvenile and young adult patients with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further classified as BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. One 20-year-old female patient has been documented as being treated with dasatinib (140 mg daily) added to her clinical trial chemotherapy. While she experienced a brief response, her disease eventually relapsed and she expired. The use of tyrosine kinase inhibitors is the focus of an ongoing prospective clinical trial evaluating the efficacy of these drugs when treating young patients with high-risk and BCR-ABL1-like B-lymphoblastic leukemia (Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02883049).",10.0

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The most commonly published breakpoint joins exon 18 of ZMIZ1 to exon 2 of ABL1 (ZMIZ1-ABL1 18-2). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(9;10)(q34.12;q22.3) and has been identified by FISH/karyotype, RT-PCR, and RNA sequencing. The fusion is in-frame and results in production of an abnormal hybrid protein, which contains one of the proline-rich domains of ZMIZ1 and the ABL1 tyrosine kinase domain. Similar to other oncogenic fusion proteins, the proline-rich domain of ZMIZ1 is involved in protein-protein interactions, and therefore the fusion may encode a constitutively activated tyrosine kinase that upregulates the mitogen-activate protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) pathways. Patients harboring the ZMIZ1-ABL1 fusion are hypothesized to be eligible for imatinib therapy.",32.5

ABL1 is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The published breakpoint joins exon 9 of SFPQ to exon 4 of ABL1 (SFPQ -ABL1). The fusion is the result of a reciprocal translocation t(1;9)(p34;q34) and has been identified by RT-PCR, Sanger sequencing, and RNA sequencing. The role of the partner gene SFPQ in this fusion remains to be investigated. SFPQ encodes for a protein belonging to a new functionally related group of fusion partners for tyrosine kinases involved in pre-mRNA processing. The presence of 2 coiled-coil domains in the 9 remaining exons of SFPQ could theoretically lead to SFPQ–ABL1 oligomerization, thus leading to constitutive activation of the resulting tyrosine kinase, as reported with other partner genes. Though uncommon, this translocation might be targeted by tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Clinical significance: The SFPQ -ABL1 fusion has been documented in six patients (3 male, 3 female) between the ages of 10 and 34 years with B-lymphoblastic leukemia, some of which were further diagnosed with BCR-ABL1 (Ph)-like subtype. Two patients had tyrosine kinase inhibitors (dasatinib + imatinib) added to their chemotherapy regimens, who did not have relapse. One additional patient who did not have tyrosine kinase inhibitor also did not suffer from relapse. The clinical details of these cases may predict response to treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Functional studies are needed to substantiate the efficacy of TKI treatment of this particular ABL-class fusion.",32.5

3227,TBL1XR1::CSF1R Fusion,"The TBL1XR1-CSF1R fusion is composed of part of the TBL1XR1 (Transducin Beta Like 1 X-Linked Receptor 1) gene at the 5’ end (N-terminus of the fusion protein), and part of the ABL1 (Colony Stimulating Factor 1 Receptor) gene at the 3’ end (C-terminus of the fusion protein). CSF1R is considered as the key partner that defines the functional/oncogenic effects of the fusion protein. The breakpoint is not published, but is predicted to be the result of a reciprocal translocation t(3;5)(q26.32;q32) and has been identified by RNA sequencing in a single pediatric patient. The consequence of this fusion with respect to treatment response and disease outcome is unknown.",7.5

4236,ALK G1202R AND v::ALK Fusion,"ALK fusion with G1202R mutation in the ALK kinase domain was first identified in a lung adenocarcinoma patient who had progressed after 10 months of responding to crizotinib. Further characterization of this variant verified crizotinib resistance and additionally demonstrated resistance to multiple next generation ALK inhibitors including ceritinib, alectinib and brigatinib. Experiments using the HSP90 inhibitor 17-AAG have indicated potential sensitivity of EML4-ALK G1202R to this drug, suggesting this variant may be an HSP90 client protein.",7.5

The mutation was absent in tumor sample taken before crizotinib treatment. Characterization of the variant using cell lines expressing EML4-ALK with 1151 T insert found the variant to be highly crizotinib resistant, and other work demonstrated resistance to next generation inhibitor alectinib, while resistance to tool compound TAE684 indicates potential resistance to the next generation ALK inhibitor ceritinib which is derived from TAE684. Other experiments suggest theraputic potential for HSP90 inhibitors, as EML4-ALK T1151 Tins sensitivity to 17-AAG has been observed.",18.0
