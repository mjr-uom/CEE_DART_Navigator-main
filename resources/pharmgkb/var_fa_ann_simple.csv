This is suggestive of higher levels of aromatase inhibition and therefore increased drug efficacy in carriers of the AG genotype. However, the variant allele (A) was associated with a significant increase in Estradiol (E2) plasma levels post-anastrozole treatment, in a followup study of 200 postmenopausal women with Breast Neoplasms. The multiplicative effect of 1 rare allele (A allele) = 12.58 fold increase in E2 levels, p=0.0002. The group concluded that allele A may result in higher expression of CYP19, providing increased targets for aromatase inhibitors thus higher changes in aromatase activity, but not resulting in higher reduction in E2 levels. This variant was shown to be in tight LD with rs7176005, which had similar association patterns.",20048079

The authors state that the high frequency of mutations at codon 543 and the large range of DPD enzyme activity (44.1-335.4 pmol/min/mg) suggest that this is a common polymorphism and is not itself associated with low enzyme activity. Note that the mean DPD activity for the entire patient population was 210 pmol/min/mg; the authors comment that a cut-off value for suspected heterozygous DPD deficiency has been suggested at 100 pmol/min/mg, though <60 pmol/min/mg (below lower limit of the 95% distribution range) perhaps should be considered.",9472650
