      "Description: Mutations in the RAS family of proteins have frequently been observed across cancer types. The amino acid positions G12, G13 and Q61 account for the overwhelming majority of these mutations. The isoforms, despite their raw similarity, also behave very differently when expressed in non-native tissue types, likely due to differences in the C-terminal hyper-variable regions. Mis-regulation of isoform expression has been shown to be a driving event in cancer, as well as missense mutations at the three hotspots previously mentioned. While highly recurrent in cancer, targeting these RAS mutants has also been very elusive, and has not yet become common practice in the clinic.\n",
      "Summary: This is an N-ras oncogene encoding a membrane protein that shuttles between the Golgi apparatus and the plasma membrane. This shuttling is regulated through palmitoylation and depalmitoylation by the ZDHHC9-GOLGA7 complex. The encoded protein, which has intrinsic GTPase activity, is activated by a guanine nucleotide-exchange factor and inactivated by a GTPase activating protein. Mutations in this gene have been associated with somatic rectal cancer, follicular thyroid cancer, autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, Noonan syndrome, and juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.

      "\t- Phase II study in 71 patients with NRAS or BRAF V600 mutant melanoma treated with MEK162. Six (20%) of 30 patients with NRAS-mutated melanoma had a partial response (three confirmed).\n",
      "\t- Mice that carried the Q61H variant had Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma and Lewis Lung Carincoma. The malignant cells where taken and each cell line was shown to readily promote lung colonization compared to NRAS WT cells. The NRAS variants drove lung metastasis via interaction with lung endothelial (CXCR1) and myeloid (CXCR2) receptors, which were required for colonization. However, the receptors were not required for tumor growth.\n",

      "\t- Established a novel mouse model for melanoma that shows for the first time that over expression of a mutant form of human N-ras (N-RasQ61K) in melanocytes results in a hyper pigmented skin phenotype and increases the formation of melanoma lesions and favors the acquisition of a metastatic behavior on an INK4a background.\n",
      "\t- In a phase1 trial, patients with advanced solid tumor harboring RAS or RAF mutation were treated with pan-RAF inhibitor Belvarafenib (HM99573/GDC-5573).\n",

Mean tumor growth was lower in the tumors treated with AZD6244+ BEZ235 (+77% vs. +267%, P=1E-6) compared to AZD6244 alone and (+77% vs. +222%, P=0.0014) BEZ235 alone. NRAS mutations were in 4/40 tumors (three Q61K, one G12D).\n",
      "\t- Two patients participating in a large retrospective trial of cetuximab in metastatic, treatment refractory colorectal cancer had tumors which harbored NRAS G12C and were wild type for KRAS, PIK3CA, and BRAF. Both experienced stable disease, which the authors classified as non-response. The two patients whose tumors harbored NRAS G12C included a 63 year old female treated with cetuximab and irinotecan as a 3rd line treatment who had PFS of 34 weeks and OS of 55 weeks; and a 38 year old female treated with cetuximab, oxaliplatin and 5FU as a 2nd line therapy who had PFS of 12 weeks.\n",
      "\t- Inhibition of CDK4 and 6, regulators of the G1/S cell cycle checkpoint, arrests the cell cycle in the G1 phase, suppresses DNA synthesis, and inhibits cancer cell growth. There is an ongoing phase 1/2 trial of binimetinib with the CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib (LEE011) in mutant NRAS melanoma patients (NCT01781572). Early results from the 21 evaluable patients were very promising, with 7 patients achieving a partial response (33%) and 11 patients with stable disease (52%)\n",
      "\t- The presence of NRAS mutation in AML patients does not impact diease prognosis (resistant disease, disease-free survival, complete remission rate, relapse rate, induction death).\n",

This patient was was a 73 year old male treated with cetuximab and irinotecan as 4th line therapy who experienced progressive disease and had PFS of 10 weeks and OS of 36 weeks.\n",
      "\t- NRAS mutations define a distinct subset of lung cancers (∼1%) with potential sensitivity to MEK inhibitors. Although NRAS mutations are more common in current/former smokers, the types of mutations are not those classically associated with smoking.\n",
      "\t- In a retrospective study of 44 malignant melanoma patients, NRAS Q61K was associated with acquired resistance to vemurafenib monotherapy in two patients with disease progressive tumors harboring NRAS Q61K and BRAF V600E (a known sensitizing mutation to vemurafenib) co-mutations, but no other genetic alterations.\n",
      "\t- The Medical Research Council (MRC) COIN trial consisted of patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum, inoperable metastatic or locoregional measurable disease, and who had not received chemotherapy for metastatic disease.\n",

      "Regardless of treatment, median overall survival was shorter in patients who had mutations in BRAF, KRAS or NRAS (n=706, 13.6 months, IQR 7.9–23.1) than in patients whose tumors were wild type for all three (n=581, 20.1 months, IQR 11.5–31.7; log-rank test p<0.0001).\n",
      "\t- In an in vitro study, a M249 cell line expressing BRAF V600E (a known sensitizing mutation to vemurafenib) and NRAS Q61K co-mutations, demonstrated resistance to vemurafenib treatment (GI50: > 10 �mol/L) compared to parental M249 cells expressing BRAF V600E and wild-type NRAS. Resistance was determined by assessing cell viability and phosphorylation of MAP2K1/2 and MAPK3/1.\n",

      "\t- NEMO is an ongoing, randomised, open-label phase 3 study of patients with advanced, unresectable, AJCC IIIC/IV NRAS-mutant melanoma. 402 patients that were previously untreated or progressed on or after previous immunotherapy were randomised to receive either binimetinib (269) or dacarbazine (133). The study's primary endpoint was progression free survival. Median follow-up was 1.7 months (IQR 1.4-4.1). Median progression-free survival was 2.8 months (95% CI 2.8-3.6) in the binimetinib group and 1.5 months (1.5-1.7) in the dacarbazine group, demonstrating improved progression-free survival of binimetinib compared with dacarbazine.\n",

MEK inhibitor JTP-74057 and PI3K/mTOR inhibitor GSK2126458 together induced synergistic increase in apoptotic Annexin V+/PI+ cells in these cell lines. Tumor xenografts in nude mice were established with 5 of the 6 cell lines. Effects of single agent treatment with JTP-74057 or GSK2126458 ranged from minor inhibition to tumor stasis, while dual inhibitor treatment showed synergistic effects in each case, with marked tumor reductions in 2/5 cases and the authors report one compete response in a MaMel301 cell line xenograft mouse.\n",

However, there was no significant difference between patients with mutant or wildtype NRAS in disease control rate, progression free survival, or overall survival. Authors note that their small sample size of patients with NRAS mutant tumors made it difficult to assess the effect of NRAS mutation on survival thus the large confidence intervals. Authors further note that the close relationship between KRAS and NRAS, and the lack of NRAS response to another EGFR inhibitor (panitumumab) support the inclusion of NRAS genotyping prior to cetuximab treatment.

The objective response rate was significantly higher with nirogacestat than placebo (41% vs. 8%).  Nirogacestat also provided significant improvements in secondary patient-reported outcomes, including pain, symptom burden, physical functioning, and health-related quality of life.  Desmoid tumors have activation of the WT pathway (with ~90% having CTNNB1 mutations and 10% harboring APC mutations) which is associated with activation of the NOTCH pathway.  According to the subgroup analysis, patients with either APC mutations or  CTNNB1 mutations showed improved progression-free survival with nirogacestat compared to placebo.  However, there are no desmoid tumor patients without CTNNB1 or APC mutations making it impossible to conclude that these mutations are the specific reason desmoid tumors respond to nirogacestat.\n",

Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes a preproprotein that is proteolytically processed to generate the mature glycoprotein. This calcium-dependent cell-cell adhesion protein is comprised of five extracellular cadherin repeats, a transmembrane region and a highly conserved cytoplasmic tail. Mutations in this gene are correlated with gastric, breast, colorectal, thyroid and ovarian cancer. Loss of function of this gene is thought to contribute to cancer progression by increasing proliferation, invasion, and/or metastasis. The ectodomain of this protein mediates bacterial adhesion to mammalian cells and the cytoplasmic domain is required for internalization.

This was followed by targeted next-generation sequencing of DNA from the renal mass with a 447-gene panel which identified a hotspot activating mutation in codon 12 of KRAS (p.G12R) at a variant-allele frequency of 8% (of 456 reads) within overall tumour cellularity of 20% (determined by a morphologic assessment); mutations were also found in GATA3 and GNAS that were of unknown clinical significance but thought to be germline in origin. KRAS-activating mutations result in constitutive activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway that may be blocked by MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitors. Therefore, we initiated treatment with cobimetinib (60 mg daily) for days 1 through 21 of a 28-day cycle. A repeat CT scan after 2 months of treatment with cobimetinib showed a substantial response.\n",

      "Description: nan\n",
      "Summary: This gene is a proto-oncogene and encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that plays a role in cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cellular transformation. The encoded protein forms a heterodimer with the related transcription factor MAX. This complex binds to the E box DNA consensus sequence and regulates the transcription of specific target genes. Amplification of this gene is frequently observed in numerous human cancers. Translocations involving this gene are associated with Burkitt lymphoma and multiple myeloma in human patients. There is evidence to show that translation initiates both from an upstream, in-frame non-AUG (CUG) and a downstream AUG start site, resulting in the production of two isoforms with distinct N-termini.

      "\t- This study found the clinical BTK/ERBB2 kinase inhibitor, ibrutinib, downregulated ERK-mediated signal transduction, cMYC Ser-62 phosphorylation and levels of MYC protein, and elicited G1 cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, in both MYC and ERBB2 amplified tumour cells, suggesting that this drug could be used to treat biomarker-selected groups of patients with oesophageal cancer.\n",
      "\t- An 82-year old male (smoker: 60 pack-years) was diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma. Initial tumor tissue testing revealed MET amplification (GCN = 13.5). The patient was enrolled in a phase 2 trial and given capmatinib (400 mg, twice daily). However, disease continued to progress through treatment. Next-generation sequencing showed MYC amplification (estimated copy number = 5). After further treatment, multiple brain metastases developed and the patient passed away. The authors suggest a MYC inhibitor such as ICX-101 to be used after capmatinib administration to inhibit resistance of cells to capmatinib.\n",
      "\t- BET inhibition by JQ1 downregulates MYC transcription, followed by genome-wide downregulation of Myc-dependent target genes. In experimental models of multiple myeloma, a Myc-dependent hematologic malignancy, JQ1 produces a potent antiproliferative effect associated with cell-cycle arrest and cellular senescence.\n",
      "\t- In 2016 the WHO added a new category of lymphoma, separate from diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, termed high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC AND [BCL2 OR BCL6] translocations. These represent less than 10% of cases of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. They may be referred to as double or triple hit lymphomas. Patients with these combination of somatic translocation variant have a poor prognosis when treated with standard therapy and increased risk of central nervous system involvement and progression. This variant specifically refers to somatic mutations in the genome typically detected by FISH or genomic assays and are distinct from expression biomarkers involving these same genes (typically defined by IHC).\n",
      "\t- A preclinical study to evaluate the efficacy of targeting the overexpressed CHEK1 cell cycle chekpoint kinase, including both miRNA and Prexasertib-induced inhibition. Both in vitro and in vivo, Prexasertib had strong single agent efficacy and augmented the effect of Olaparib or Cisplatin in either combination, including platinum-resistant models. CHEK1 and MYC overexpression were predictors of response.\n",
      "\t- Collectively data from expression analysis of 102 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) sample tissues established MYC and HSP90 as potential targets with overexpression of MYC observed in over half the patient samples and strong levels of HSP90 in nearly ≥47% cases of all tumors. In vitro, the relative protein expression analysis of 5 ESCC cell lines displayed concurrent overexpression of HSP90 and MYC in both KYSE-150 and Eca-109 cell lines, while overexpression of HSP90 was solely found in EC-1, TE-13 and HESS. Treatment of STA-9090 an HSP90 inhibitor, inhibited ESCC proliferation with significant sensitivity shown in cell lines overexpressing HSP90 and MYC proteins (KYSE-150 with a IC50 value of 29.32 nM and Eca-109 with a value of 69.44nM). In vivo experiments also showed benefit of STA-9090 in MYC expressing PDX models, and no beneficial effect of STA-9090 in MYC-low ESCC PDX models. These findings are indicative of potential use in ESCC tissues with the patient populations possessing overexpression of HSP90 and MYC proteins.\n",
      "\t- MYC and BCL2 rearrangements together are defining diagnostic features of this new entity\n",
      "\t- Group 3 medulloblastomas with MYC amplifications are often associated with large cell/anaplastic histology, young patients, and overall poor prognosis.\n",
      "\t- MYC translocations, often (but not always) involving immunoglobulin loci, are common in DLBCL and one of two defining features of high-grade B-cell lymphoma with MYC and BCL2 rearrangements\n",
      "\t- A patient diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma had cells cultured to create patient-derived cell lines. Such cells exhibited MET amplification and showed overexpression of MYC. Capmatinib was administered with doses ranging from 0 - 10 uM with drug resistance, consistent with drug resistance in vivo. However, ICX-101, a MYC inhibitor, showed sensitivity and was tested in combination and sequentially with capmatinib. The authors report that when cell lines were treated with capmatinib and subsequently with ICX-101, there was a synergistic anti-tumor effect. The authors suggest a MYC inhibitor could be utilized to inhibit resistance to capmatinib.\n",

      "Summary: The protein encoded by this gene is a negative regulator of the cell cycle and was the first tumor suppressor gene found. The encoded protein also stabilizes constitutive heterochromatin to maintain the overall chromatin structure. The active, hypophosphorylated form of the protein binds transcription factor E2F1. Defects in this gene are a cause of childhood cancer retinoblastoma (RB), bladder cancer, and osteogenic sarcoma. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008].\n",

      "\t- In Capan-1 cell lines engineered to reduce pRB expression (by transfection with p16), resensitization to chemotherapy-induced apoptosis was observed. The effect was asserted to be specific to pRB depletion because, in two separate cell lines, also transfected with p16, that retained high pRB expression, chemotherapy resistance was still observed.\n",
      "\t- Three patients with hormone receptor positive metastastic breast cancer, treated with letrozol/ribociclib or fulvestrant/palbociclib, underwent RB1 gene sequencing before, during and after acquiring resistance to therapy. ctDNA analyses revealed the emergence of RB1 mutations after but not before progression on CDK4/6 Inhibitors.\n",
      "\t- Study evaluated a total of 50 small cell lung cancer patients with extensive stage disease. Multivariate analysis identified RB1 as a factor in predicting response to first-line chemotherapy (odds ratio 5.58 compared to WT, p=.038). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed patients with RB1 mutations exhibited better overall survival (p = .04, 11.7 versus 9.1 months, CI = 1.1-28.2).\n",
      "\t- The study investigated the sensitivity of RB1-mutant osteosarcoma cell lines to PARPi. It found that cell viability, measured by AUC values after 5 days, was significantly lower in RB1-defective cell lines compared to RB1-normal lines when treated with three different PARPi: olaparib, niraparib, and talazoparib. Further, the study confirmed this selective sensitivity using clonogenic assays for all three PARPi in RB1-defective osteosarcoma cells. Overall, the study establishes an association between PARPi sensitivity and RB1-defective status in otherwise PARPi insensitive osteosarcoma.\n",
      "\t- We have used polyclonal anti-synthetic peptide serum to study the role of retinoblastoma gene (RB) inactivation in a variety of human tumor cell lines. Our analysis indicates that inactivation of the RB protein, p105-Rb, is universal in retinoblastoma cells, vindicating the predictions of the Knudson \"two-hit\" hypothesis. In addition, our analysis has shown that inactivations of the RB gene are nearly as frequent in a more common human tumor, small cell lung carcinoma. One-third of bladder carcinomas surveyed also carry altered or absent p105-Rb. Other human tumors by contrast demonstrate only infrequent inactivation of the RB gene. These results suggest that inactivation of the RB gene is a critical step in the pathogenesis of a subset of human tumors.\n",
      "\t- In this phase III trial (PALOMA-3), patients with ER+, HER2- advanced breast cancer were treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors. Patients were randomized to receive palbociclib plus fulvestrant (P+F) or placebo plus fulvestrant (F). A paired ctDNA exome sequencing was conducted to analyze clonal composition. RB1 mutations were identified in 6/127 patients (p=0.041), part of the P + F arm, while no RB1 mutations were identified in the patients treated with fulvestrant alone, at EOT (end of treatment). ESR1 mutations were noted in 25.1% at day 1, and 31.3% of the patients at EOT. An increased proportion of PIK3CA mutations were noted at EOT compared to day 1  (19% v/s 26.7%; p = 0.00069). Additionally, the proportions of patients with new PIK3CA mutations did not differ between the two treatment groups, which suggests that these mutations may play a role in fulvestrant resistance. Strong evidence was reported for positive selection for ESR1 Y537S through the treatment in both treatment groups (p=0.0037), suggesting this mutation may promote resistance to fulvestrant. The data also indicates that resistance to fulvestrant may be a major genetic driver of resistance to the combination treatment.\n",
      "\t- A drug screen of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines found several therapies to be synthetically lethal with RB1 loss of function. Cell lines with endogenous expression of RB1 (BT20, MB453, MCF7, and MB231) were resistant to PLK inhibitor volasertib, while those with RB1 loss (MB468, BT549, AW23) or experimental knockdown had increased sensitivity. In addition, inhibition of CDK4/6 upstream of RB1 reduced sensitivity to volasertib in RB1-positive cells (MB231).\n",
      "\t- This study reportedly sequenced 1001 DLBCL tumors using whole exome sequencing. They reported 150 recurrently mutated genes. Some concerns about the validity of the results have been expressed in subsequent studies. Only genes that have been confirmed by other similar studies were added to CIViC at this time.\n",
      "\t- The p110alpha-specific PI3K inhibitor BYL719 (Alpelisib) was used on a panel of five PI3K inhibitor sensitive and five resistant breast cancer cell lines. Sensitive cells (IC50<400nM) showed reduced phospho-Rb (p-Rb) western blot levels in response to BYL719 treatment, while resistant cell lines (IC50>800nM) showed significantly less reduction in p-Rb after BYL719. Paired biopsies before and after treatment were taken from a set of eight patients classified as either responder or non-responder to BYL719. Responder samples showed significantly reduced p-Rb staining after treatment in comparison to non-responder biopsies. In biopsies taken from a group of three responders who progressed, p-Rb levels were increased after progression.\n",
      "\t- A phase II clinical study was conducted with 29 patients with Non-Small-Cell Lung Cancer harboring CDKN2A alterations and wild-type Rb. The study reported one patient with a partial response, and six patients with SD for a duration of at least 16 weeks. The disease control rate was 31% (90% CI, 19-40). The PFS and OS observed were 8.1 weeks (95% CI, 7.1 - 16.0) and 21.6 weeks (95% CI. 14.1-41.1) respectively. At least one grade 3 or 4 adverse event or serious adverse event was reported in 11 patients, likely associated with palbociclib.\n",
      "\t- Positive RB1 expression (2+ by IHC) was associated with adverse outcomes in a cohort of 73 cases with stage I and II NSCLC (P<0.001) in this retrospective study. This finding was independent from other genomic and clinical factors explored by the authors.\n",
      "\t- Preclinical study in breast cancer cell lines treated with CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib. Palbociclib-resistant xenografts from one cell line (PDX244) were developed in-vivo. In resistant xenografts, western blot analysis showed a decrease of pRb protein levels in 4 of 7 CDK4/6-acquired resistant tumors and a sustained expression of the E2F target cyclin E2, in contrast to CDK4/6 inhibitor-sensitive PDX244. Genomic characterization of PDX244LR1 showed the acquisition of an RB1 frameshift mutation (RB1 p.M695fs*26).\n",
      "\t- A drug screen of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell lines found several therapies to be synthetically lethal with RB1 loss of function.

In addition, inhibition of CDK4/6 upstream of RB1 reduced sensitivity to AZD7762 in RB1-positive cells (MB231). Cell cycle analysis indicated that CHK1 inhibition in RB deficient cells resulted in the appearance of fragmented nuclei and S phase collapse, which indicates irreparable DNA damage during S phase.\n",

      "\t- A panel of 21 glioblastoma cell lines harboring various mutations was treated with palbociclib. 16 of the cell lines with intact Rb showed decreased proliferation (bromodeoxyuridine incorporation, BrdU flow cytometry) and growth arrest characteristic of senescence, while the 5 cell lines that did not show a palbociclib response had homozygous deletion of Rb. Rb positive and palbociclib responsive GBM cell line U87MG was treated with shRNA against Rb. shRb treated cells showed restoration of cell proliferation (BrdU incorporation) under palbociclib treatment, indicating resistance.\n",
      "\t- In this study, the sensitivity of RB1 mutated cancer cells to AURKAi LY3295668 has been investigated.  Enhanced cytotoxicity was reported in RB1 depleted lung and breast cancer cells in response to the AURKAi. However, the same cytotoxicity wasn't observed in AURKA gene knockout cells.\n",
      "\t- In 3 ER positive and 2 ER negative breast cancer cell lines with intact Rb, significant growth inhibition, as measured by BrdU incorporation, was seen with incubation in CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib (PD-0332991). In contrast, two ER negative cell lines lacking detectable Rb were fully resistant to palbociclib. Knockdown of Rb in 3 of the tested Rb positive cell lines led to moderate palbociclib resistance in short term incubation experiments. \n",
      "In longer term (15 day) palbociclib incubations of ER negative MDA-MB-231 cells and ER positive MCF-7 cells, significant resistance to palbociclib was seen in Rb knockdown conditions while wild-type Rb cells maintained sensitivity.\n",
