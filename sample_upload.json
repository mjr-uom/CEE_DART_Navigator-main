A core-needle biopsy of the renal mass on the left side revealed infiltration of fibroadipose tissue with sheets of large histiocytic forms that were positive for S100 but negative for factor XIIIa. The immunophenotype and the presence of emperipolesis were consistent with Rosai–Dorfman disease. The patient received prednisone but had no response. This was followed by targeted next-generation sequencing of DNA from the renal mass with a 447-gene panel which identified a hotspot activating mutation in codon 12 of KRAS (p.G12R) at a variant-allele frequency of 8% (of 456 reads) within overall tumour cellularity of 20% (determined by a morphologic assessment); mutations were also found in GATA3 and GNAS that were of unknown clinical significance but thought to be germline in origin.
