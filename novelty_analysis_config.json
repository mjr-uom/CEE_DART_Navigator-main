  "context": "The aim here is to identify differences between responders (pCR) and non-responders (RD) in the two different treatment arms (T-DM1, DHP). The Breast cancer team in the group suggest that non-responding patients have activation of alternative signaling pathways and responding patients have increased anti-tumor immune activity during HER2-targeted treatment. We discovered a significant differences in interactions between the genes when comparing responders vs non-responders.",
  "question": "To what extend the evidence related to these genes explain the fact that one group responds to the treatment?"
